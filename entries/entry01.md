# Entry 1

There is a rubric to follow for writing this but to me, it isn't clear what we are supposed to be writing about. So for this entry I'm just going to be writing about the reason I choose melonjs as my tool. One of my favorite things to do is play videogames, however, videogames are more of a hobby than a job for the majority of people. For this reason, I thought it would be cool to make my own game. This is where I came across melonjs. Melonjs is a code library that is mainly used for making games. After coming across melonjs, I decided to look into it further, and came to the conclusion that I should make a platformer game. Although I have no knowledge in making videogames, I feel that melonjs would be a great introductory into the field.
